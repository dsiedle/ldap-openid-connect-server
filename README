## Introduction:

This is a version of the MITREid Connect server that speaks to a backend samba4 (and probably Microsoft AD...) LDAP system for its user information and authentication.

### To use it:  
1/ Take the main openid-connect-server project and build it:  

2/ Insert a clone of this projet inside openid-connect project.

3/ In src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/user-context.xml :   
=> set ${ldap.server}, ${ldap.url}, ${ldap.userDn} and ${ldap.password}  

4/ In src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/server-config.xml :  
=> replace issuer property value with your value.  

5/ Build this project and deploy it on tomcat or other java web server...
